# Data Exploration
This folder consists of two Jupyter Notebooks that was used for preliminary data processing and analysis. After playing with these notebooks and obtaining insight into the dataset, we created more refined and task specific preprocessing and imputation pipelines. We still keep these ones since they contain useful functions to understand the stastics of features along with groupings of features with respect to their values.

### Directory Files
